or whatever.

Production-ready stuff is in `/dist`.

Otherwise, ESM:

  resultContainer: "#blathers-container",
});
```

There is a patched version of Zebra Crossing (also based off thulinma's [work](https://github.com/Thulinma/zxing-js-library/tree/c0584ff4133dd68fc996ac8e45cdff40a6d1f483)) included in this project that should work out of the box. If not, fuss at Joseph.
