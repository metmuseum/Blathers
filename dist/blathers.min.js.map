For this application,\n * it does a much better job than a global blackpoint with severe shadows and gradients.\n * However it tends to produce artifacts on lower frequency images and is therefore not\n * a good general purpose binarizer for uses outside ZXing.\n *\n * This class extends GlobalHistogramBinarizer, using the older histogram approach for 1D readers,\n * and the newer local approach for 2D readers. 1D decoding using a per-row histogram is already\n * inherently local, and only fails for horizontal gradients. We can revisit that problem later,\n * but for now it was not a win to use local blocks for 1D.\n *\n * This Binarizer is the default for the unit tests and the recommended class for library users.\n *\n * @author dswitkin@google.com (Daniel Switkin)\n */\nvar HybridBinarizer = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(HybridBinarizer, _super);\n    function HybridBinarizer(source) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this, source) || this;\n        _this.matrix = null;\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Calculates the final BitMatrix once for all requests.
